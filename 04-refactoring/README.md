# AI-Assisted Code Refactoring Module

This directory contains notebooks for learning code refactoring using AI assistance tools like GitHub Copilot. The notebooks provide hands-on exercises to improve code quality through modern programming practices.

## Notebooks

- [`refactoring - easy.ipynb`](refactoring%20-%20easy.ipynb): An introductory notebook focusing on basic refactoring principles using a simple GradeCalculator class. Perfect for beginners learning about code improvement techniques.

- [`refactoring - intermediate.ipynb`](refactoring%20-%20intermediate.ipynb): A more advanced notebook using a SoilDataProcessor class that demonstrates complex refactoring scenarios with real-world data processing examples.

## Getting Started

To begin the refactoring workshop:

1. Ensure you have access to GitHub Copilot in your development environment
2. Open the notebooks in order (easy â†’ intermediate)
3. Follow the exercises and prompts within each notebook
4. Try the refactoring suggestions and experiment with your own improvements

## Workshop Structure

Each notebook follows a consistent structure:

1. Initial code presentation
2. Code analysis exercise
3. Guided refactoring using Copilot
4. Prompt crafting practice
5. Discussion of improvements

## Learning Objectives

Through these notebooks, participants will learn:
- How to identify code that needs improvement
- Effective use of AI tools for code refactoring
- Modern Python programming practices including:
  - Using pandas for data processing
  - Implementing proper error handling
  - Adding type hints and documentation
  - Using logging instead of print statements
  - Writing more maintainable code
